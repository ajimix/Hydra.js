		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
                Install Hydra.
			</li>
			<li>
                Install/create a wrapper extension for your base framework (jQuery, Prototype...)
			</li>
			<li>
				What is a module?
			</li>
			<li>
				How to create a module.
			</li>
			<li>
				How to use events to communicate between modules.
			</li>

			<strong>What type of questions do you have?</strong>

		<div>
			<h4 id="refreshmodulesinfo">I want to remember how to use modules.</h4>
			<p class="h4">
				You can refresh your knowledge about modules reading <a href="#quickstart"><strong>Quick start</strong></a> if you need more info about advanced info I recommend you to go to <a href="#reference_guide"><strong>Reference Guide</strong></a> and read the modules section.

		<h4 id="knowaboutpublicapi">I need to know what is the public API.</h4>
		<p class="h4">
            If you are interested to see some examples of usage of the different public methods I recommend you Reference Guide where you could search in the table of contents and find what you are looking for.
		</p>
		<p class="h4">
            If you are interested more in the code that in examples or you're an experienced Javascript developer I recommend you to go to APIs section where you will find all the JSDoc documentation about the code. You will find a link to download it if you want to use it locally.
